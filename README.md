Create, store, edit Haikus and generate QR codes.

The structure of a traditional haiku is always the same, fowwling these basic rules or a basic algorithm:

- There are only three lines, totaling 17 syllables.

- The first line is 5 syllables.

- The second line is 7 syllables.

-The third line is 5 syllables like the first.

Punctuation and capitalization are up to the poet.
A haiku does not have to rhyme, in fact usually it does not rhyme at all.

Haikus and QR codes originated in Japan and share a minimalist computational esthetic. Hai-QR allows you to create, store and visulaize Haikus as functional QR codes. Hai-QR is an exploration of the poetics of technologies of composition and transcoding.
